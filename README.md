======
Wb-fun is a tool to allow access to blocked search results on Sina Weibo.

Sina Weibo is the so-called Chinese Twitter. When you search for certain "sensitive" keywords 
(eg 昆明+PX), Weibo states that due to government policy they cannot show you any search results. 
However, oftentimes posts which contain the term still do exist and have not been deleted from the 
site. By truncating your search keyword (昆明+P or 明+PX), you can often find relevant posts that 
contain your original blocked keyword or a close variation of it.

This tool aims to be a simple-to-install and use bookmarklet or browser extension that 

1. quickly performs that search behind the scenes;

2. identifies the most likely to be relevant search results;

3. presents them to the user.
